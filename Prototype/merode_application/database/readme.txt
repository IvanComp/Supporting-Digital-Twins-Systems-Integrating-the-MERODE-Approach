later version of hsqldb (e.g. 2.2.4) requires length for varchar to be defined 
whereas older (1.8.0.10) doesn't need length argument defined

small test can be found at: http://www.javablogging.com/embedded-database-in-java-use-of-hsqldb/


choose standalone and define your database file, e.g for PROTOTYPE it's database_file
